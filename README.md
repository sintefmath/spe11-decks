# SPE11-CSP input files

This repository contains example input files for the SPE11-CSP used for simulator testing.

## Limitations

The cases have been simplified for testing purposes. The current purpose of this repo is to have available simple black-oil cases that can be directly run in OPM/MRST/commercial simulators and cross-validate this against other implementations of the PVT tables described in the CSP. Notably, this means that the cases have diffusion, dispersion and thermal effects removed. No real effort has been made to make sure that the grids are K-orthogonal or have appropriate resolution. This may change in the future.

## Additional Information

The current cases are generated by [pyopmspe11](https://github.com/OPM/pyopmspe11). Variants without the OPM specific CO2STORE option has been manually made using the PVT table generation found at the official [11th SPE CSP repository](https://github.com/Simulation-Benchmarks/11thSPE-CSP).

:warning: These files are primarily intended for testing, cross-validating and verifying simulators. If you are intending to participate in the CSP, please take care to understand the simplifications and limitations.
